•	Complete beginners start here!
o	Students should pay particular attention to the “Publishing via GitHub” https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Publishing_your_website#publishing_via_github and the “GitHub Setup” module in DC Connect 
•	Assigned class readings that will facilitate with the tutorials for this assignment can be found under the “HTML – Structuring the web” section in the Introduction to HTML module 
Submission Requirements

Students will do the following as part of the submission of their completed assignment will provide the clickable links to each page created/modified and committed/published to GitHub for this assignment in the DC Connect Assignment 1 Dropbox.
Students are also to ensure that they have added their professor to be “collaborators” on their repositories so they can access and view the commit log for your assignment files.
NOTE: see the “GitHub Setup” module in DC Connect for setup instructions.
If the link is submitted late into the assignment drop box a 25% penalty will be applied to the overall assignment.  After 72 hours of the original due date, the drop box will close in DC a mark of zero (0) will be given for the assignment.
HTML Comments

For each and every *.html file that is created for this course, students are to include <!--HTML Comments --> these will be in the form:
	<!--
	Name: Your Name
	File: filename.html
	Date: XX September 202X
	A very brief description of the file.
	-->

Where students will replace the placeholders with the appropriate information.
HTML5 Validation
For all *.html files created/submitted in this course, for full marks, MUST be validated to the HTML5 standard.
To achieve this, the first four (4) lines of the *.html file(s) have to be:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">

Created HTML content should be checked through an HTML5 validator (there are several on the Web).  Your instructor will check each file to ensure compliance.
GitHub Requirements
For each and every text type (*.html or *.css) file published as part of the assignment submission, there must be at least five (5) change commits.  NOTE: The first two will always be the same and more than five commits is allowed, if it makes sense to do so.
1.	An initial commit when students add the unmodified/provided tutorial files from the MDN web docs pages.
2.	The second commit should be made after <!--HTML Comments--> are added to every file
3.	A commit when it makes sense to do so.
4.	A commit when it makes sense to do so.
5.	A commit when the files are ready to be published onto the remote GitHub repository
Once the final commit is completed, students are to use GitHub desktop to publish their files for submission by clicking on the Push Origin button. NOTE: files can be pushed at anytime, but it is imperative that the final versions of the files are pushed to ensure that the changes are assessed.
